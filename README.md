# DCGANForMicromillingTool


DCGAN Application for checking feasibility of generating cutting tool images.

Micromilling tools are degrading and broken as they are used in the milling process. I tried to apply feasibility of producing cutting tool images according to their condition. We didn't decide to continue since the number of images are not much in the literature, cutting conditions and tool material diversity. It can be used to generalize the idea of cutting tool but it is not feasible for useful applications on micromilling.
